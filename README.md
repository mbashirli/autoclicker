# autoclicker
A software developed in Python that allows the user to automate daily tasks involving mouse and keyboard through the usage of entered coordinates. 

Selected clicks are added to the table through a sqlite3 database with the x and y coordinates, as well as delay times and repetitions. The script executes with any key the user desires.
